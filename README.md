Goals:
Our project aims to develop a comprehensive database for an online shoe store, that will
streamline the process of selling various types of shoes. The database will include tables for
managing orders, shoes, and customers, along with additional categories to classify shoes
by price, purpose, size, and more. To make the user experience seamless, we plan to design a
user-friendly online store interface where customers can easily browse, place, and delete orders,
as well as view their existing orders.
